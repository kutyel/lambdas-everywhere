Let's see if this thing works...

## Some code?

```jsx
<SomeCode />

```
---

<Code
  dark
  title="before"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./components/datepicker.js")}
  steps={[
    { lines: [6], notes: "Note for the first step" },
    { range: [5, 9] },
    { tokens: { 9: [3, 4, 5] }, notes: "Note for the third step" }
  ]}
/>

---

<Code
  dark
  title="after (recompose)"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./components/recompose.js")}
  steps={[
    { lines: [6], notes: "Note for the first step" },
    { range: [5, 9] },
    { tokens: { 9: [3, 4, 5] }, notes: "Note for the third step" }
  ]}
/>
